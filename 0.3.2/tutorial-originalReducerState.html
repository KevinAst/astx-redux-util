<article>
    <p>This sidebar discussion provides some insight into
<strong>originalReducerState</strong> (<em>mostly an internal implementation detail</em>).</p>
<p>A fundamental aspect of sequentially joining reducers is that each
reducer should be able to build on what has been accomplished by a
prior reducer.  In essence it is an accumulative process.</p>
<p>The <a href="global.html#joinReducers"><code>joinReducers</code></a> utility handles this by cumulatively passing the
state parameter that was returned from any prior reducer (in the chain
of reducers to execute).</p>
<p>While this does NOT relax the immutable constraint of the reducer's
state parameter, it is possible for a down-stream reducer to receive a
state parameter that is a different instance from the start of the
reduction process (because an up-stream reducer needed to alter it in
some way).</p>
<p>As it turns out, this is typically NOT a concern to a client, rather
merely an implementation detail.</p>
<p>There are edge cases, however, where a client needs visibility to the
<strong>originalReducerState</strong>: <em>the immutable state at the start of the
reduction process</em>.  One case in particular is determining that state
has changed within a series of reductions (i.e. <a href="global.html#joinReducers"><code>joinReducers</code></a>),
because each individual reducer only has visibility of the state
within it's own reduction process.  This case is higlighted in
<a href="tutorial-fullExample.html">A Most Excellent Example</a>.</p>
<p>As a result, the <strong>originalReducerState</strong> is <strong>publicly exposed</strong> as
the 3rd parameter to the <a href="global.html#conditionalReducerCB"><code>conditionalReducerCB</code></a> function (the
<a href="global.html#conditionalReducer"><code>conditionalReducer</code></a> callback parameter that makes this
determination).</p>
<p>Internally, the way in which astx-redux-util manages the
originalReducerState is by passing it as a 3rd parameter to any
reducer it is in control of (i.e. invokes).  While from a redux
perspective, this is non-standard, it doesn't really hurt, because
reducer functions are NOT reasoning about a 3rd parameter.  The only
risk is if redux should (at some future point) start to employ
additional reducer parameters.</p>
<p>By an overwhelming majority of the time (99.9%), <strong>you should seldom have
to worry about how originalReducerState is maintained</strong>, because
astx-redux-util does this for you.</p>
<p><strong>The only time any of this concerns you</strong> is if your application
reducer invokes one of the astx-redux-util reducers.  In this case
(which is rare), your code is responsible for passing
originalReducerState (the 3rd reducer parameter) to the downstream
reducer.</p>
