This section provides some insight into why astx-redux-util was
created, and how it compares to other similar utilities.

One of the astx-redux-util functions ({@link reducerHash}) is a stock
feature in other reducer libraries, such as [redux-actions
handleactions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-actions#handleactionsreducermap-defaultstate).
With that said, astx-redux-util promotes other reducer compositions
that can be used in conjunction with one another.

**SideBar**: One underlying reason astx-redux-util was created was to provide my
initial exposure into npm publishing.  Because I am new to both Node and
GitHub, and I wanted a small project, where I could focus on the setup
and tooling required for publishing a micro-library.  This also
includes various aspects of project documentation (something that is
important to me).

The astx-redux-util library was pulled directly out of a sandbox
project that I used to learn a number of technologies and frameworks.

My hope is to eventually add more astx-redux-util functionality from
my sandbox project.  One aspect in particular is related to managing
action creators with a twist: consistently maintaining action types in
conjunction with action creators.

I hope you enjoy this effort, and comments are welcome.
