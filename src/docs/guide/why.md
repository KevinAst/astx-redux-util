This section provides a brief insight into why astx-redux-util was
created, and how it compares to other similar utilities.

Some astx-redux-util functions (i.e. {@link reducerHash}) are stock
features in other reducer libraries, such as such as [redux-actions
handleactions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-actions#handleactionsreducermap-defaultstate).
With that said, astx-redux-util promotes other reducer compositions
that can be used in conjunction with one another.

One underlying reason astx-redux-util was created was to provide my
initial exposure into npm publishing.  Because I am new to both Node and
GitHub, and I wanted a small project, where I could focus on the setup
and tooling required for publishing a micro-library.  This also
includes various aspects of project documentation (something that is
important to me).

astx-redux-util was pulled directly out of a sandbox project that I
used to learn a number of technologies and frameworks.

My hope is to eventually add more functionality from my sandbox
project.  One aspect in particular is related to managing action
creation with a twist: consistently maintaining action types in
conjunction with action creators.

&lt;/Kevin&gt;
