# Concepts

- {{book.guide.conceptHash}} ... using {{book.api.reducerHash}}, eliminate
  the switch statement commonly found in reducers *("look ma, no
  switch")*

- {{book.guide.conceptConditional}} ... using
  {{book.api.conditionalReducer}}, invoke a reducer only when
  certain constraints are met *("to reduce or NOT to reduce; that is
  the question")*

- {{book.guide.conceptJoin}} ... using {{book.api.joinReducers}}, team up
  multiple reducers to promote higher order functionality *("working
  together is success" - Henry Ford)*
