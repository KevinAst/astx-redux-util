    <p>??? provide linkage (when classes are available.</p>
<p>The conditionalReducer exposes an &quot;originalReducerState&quot; parameter to
it's comparator function.  </p>
<p>The originalReducerState represents the immutable state at the time of
the start of the reduction process.  This is useful in determining
that state has changed within a series of reductions (because each
individual reducer only has visibility of the state within it's own
reduction process).</p>
<p>There is an example of this in ???.</p>
<p>Because this deals with how state changes over a series of reducers
(run in sequence), it is natural that the joinReducers utility
automatically maintains the originalReducerState.</p>
<p>By an overwhelming majority (99.9% of the time), you should never have
to worry about how this state is maintained, because joinReducers does
this for you.</p>
<p>With that said, the way in which originalReducerState is communicated
(internally), is by passing it as a 3rd parameter through the reducer
chain.  While from a redux perspective, this is non-standard, it
doesn't really hurt, because reducer functions are NOT reasoning about
a 3rd parameter.  The only risk is if redux should (at some
future point) start to employ additional reducer parameters.</p>
<p>Here are the significant take-away points of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If your conditionalReducer comparators never reason about
originalReducerState:</p>
<ul>
<li>Then you have NO worries whatsoever!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If your conditionalReducer comparators DO reason about
originalReducerState:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the normal use case (where your conditionalReducer is
orchestrated by a joinReducers - in the first order), then you
STILL have NOTHING to worry about!</p>
<p>Please Note: The points above cover 99.9% of all use cases!</p>
</li>
<li><p>If however, your conditionalReducer is invoked in a less
conventional way, then you must manually supply the appropriate
originalReducerState 3rd parameter when invoking the reducer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This could be when you are invoking the conditionalReducer
directly (outside of a joinReducers utility).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Or if you have a nested joinReducers combination.</p>
